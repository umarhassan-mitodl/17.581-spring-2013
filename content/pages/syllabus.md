Course Description
------------------

The course aims to enhance the student's ability to analyze contentious and violent political events. The first section addresses four different individual level mechanisms that drive individual participation in these eventsâ€”rationality, psychological forces, social norms, and emotions. The second section examines how these individual level forces aggregate and combine. The third section applies the lessons from the first two sections to analyze variation in U.S. riots over the course of the Twentieth Century. The fourth section examines contentious events, both in violent and non-violent forms, during the course of the collapse of Communism in Eastern Europe. The fifth section discusses major social revolutions. The sixth section applies the course theories and methods to the Arab Spring and current conflict in Mali.
